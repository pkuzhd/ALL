Department of Geography and Human Environment, School of Geoscience, Tel Aviv University
Established in 1966, TAU Department of Geography and Human Environment (DGHE), is a leader in research and education in Geosciences. Teaching and research are inherently interdisciplinary integrating the humanities, natural and social sciences. Students are provided with basic and advanced training through studies in a broad historical and cultural context covering theoretical and applied aspects of Geography together with essential laboratory and practical work, allowing them to develop a wide variety of individual specializations in a wide spectrum of topics including: social geography, urban planning, spatial modeling, GIS, remote sensing, climatology and geohydrology.
Small by design, DGHE punches above its weight, in Israel and internationally. Ten academic staff members cooperate closely in research and student supervision, publish regularly in books and leading international journals (30-40 peer reviewed papers annually), organize national and international conferences, participate in editorial boards and enjoy a good reputation internationally. DGHE has been awarded numerous research grants, including Israel Science Foundation (ISF), German Israel Foundation (GIF) and EU-FP7 awards (EOâ€“MINERS, EUFAR, ENSURE). Four members were awarded the prestigious Israel Prize for distinction in scholarship and research.
